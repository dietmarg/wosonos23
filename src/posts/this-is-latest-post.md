As a researching and teaching ethnologist and during longer stay abroad (in Israel, Russia, Poland, France) I argued early and intensely with human everyday culture and practiced in varied environments, branches and regions of the world. I allowed myself to be irritated and enchanted, shock and for a certain time taken in by manifold perspectives on the world and global like local differences and common characteristics. I saw the most different working and life concepts, gender and family concepts, leadership and working styles.

In parallel with the scientific discussion on the variety and complexity of human culture disclosed to me by my education, my work as a mediator and the following practical work with people in workshops, trainings and consultations inspired a sensory-like linkings between theory and practice. Mutual learning processes between the work, communication and interaction, began and found entrance in varied publications and the advancement of training methods within. This process continues and is continuously inspired by the active exchange with colleagues.
